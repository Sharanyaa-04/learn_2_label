## What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on **Bayes’ theorem** with a strong independence assumption between features.

---

## Type of Problem It Solves

Naive Bayes solves classification problems where probabilistic reasoning is effective.

---

## Core Idea

The model computes the probability of each class given the input features and selects the most probable class.

---

## Independence Assumption

Features are assumed to be conditionally independent given the class label.

---

## Strengths

- Very fast training and prediction  
- Works well with high-dimensional data  
- Effective with small datasets  

---

## Limitations

- Independence assumption is often unrealistic  
- Lower performance when features are strongly correlated  

---

## Training Process

Model parameters are estimated directly from data using probability distributions.
