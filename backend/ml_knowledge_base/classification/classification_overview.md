## What is Classification?

Classification is a supervised learning approach that predicts **discrete class labels** from input features.

Instead of predicting numeric values, classification assigns inputs to predefined categories.

---

## Type of Problem It Solves

Classification solves problems where the target variable represents a **class or category**, such as yes/no or multiple classes.

---

## Core Idea

Classification learns decision boundaries that separate different classes in the feature space.

---

## Common Classification Models

- Logistic Regression  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Trees

## When Classification Is Used

Classification is used when:
- Outputs are categorical  
- Decisions or labels are required  
- Class membership matters more than numeric value
