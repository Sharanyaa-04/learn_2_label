## What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

A Support Vector Machine is a classification algorithm that finds a **decision boundary maximizing the margin** between classes.

---

## Type of Problem It Solves

SVM solves binary and multiclass classification problems, especially with high-dimensional data.

---

## Core Idea

SVM identifies support vectors and constructs a boundary that best separates classes.

---

## Kernel Concept

Kernels allow SVMs to model nonlinear decision boundaries by transforming input features.

---

## Strengths

- Effective in high-dimensional spaces  
- Robust to overfitting with proper regularization  
- Flexible through kernel functions  

---

## Limitations

- Computationally expensive on large datasets  
- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning  

---

## Training Process

Parameters are learned by solving a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the margin.
