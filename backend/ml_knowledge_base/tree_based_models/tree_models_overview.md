## What Are Tree-Based Models?

Tree-based models are supervised learning algorithms that make predictions by **recursively splitting data** based on feature values.

They represent decisions in a tree-like structure composed of nodes, branches, and leaves.

---

## Type of Problems They Solve

Tree-based models can solve:
- Regression problems (predicting numeric values)
- Classification problems (predicting class labels)

---

## Core Idea

The model learns a sequence of decision rules that split data into increasingly homogeneous groups.

Each final group (leaf node) produces a prediction.

## Common Tree-Based Models

- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosted Trees

## When Tree-Based Models Are Used

Tree-based models are used when:
- Relationships between features are nonlinear
- Interpretability is important
- Feature interactions matter
