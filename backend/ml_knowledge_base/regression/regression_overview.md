## What is Regression?

Regression is a supervised learning approach that models the relationship between input features and a **continuous numerical output**.

The objective of regression is to predict numeric values rather than discrete classes.

## Type of Problem It Solves

Regression solves problems where the target variable represents a quantity, such as price, time, or measurement.

## Core Idea

Regression learns how changes in input variables affect a numeric outcome, enabling prediction on unseen data.

## Common Regression Models

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Tree-based regression models

## When Regression Is Used

Regression is used when:
- The output is continuous
- Relationships between variables can be modeled
- Numeric prediction is required
