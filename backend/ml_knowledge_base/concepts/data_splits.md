## Training, Validation, and Test Sets

### Training Set
Used to learn model parameters.

### Validation Set
Used to tune hyperparameters and select models.

### Test Set
Used only for final evaluation of model performance.

**Why this matters**  
Separating data helps measure how well a model generalizes to unseen data.
