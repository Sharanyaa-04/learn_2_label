## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
Uses labeled data, where each input is paired with a known output.  
The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

### Unsupervised Learning
Uses unlabeled data, where no explicit output is provided.  
The goal is to discover structure or patterns in the data.

**Key difference**  
Supervised learning learns from labeled examples; unsupervised learning does not.
