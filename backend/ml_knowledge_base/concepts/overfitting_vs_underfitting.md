## Overfitting vs Underfitting

### Overfitting
Occurs when a model learns noise instead of underlying patterns, resulting in low training error but high test error.

### Underfitting
Occurs when a model is too simple to capture patterns, resulting in high error on both training and test data.

**Key difference**  
Overfitting memorizes; underfitting oversimplifies.
