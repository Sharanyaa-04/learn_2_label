## Bias–Variance Tradeoff

### Bias
Error caused by overly simple assumptions in a model.

### Variance
Error caused by sensitivity to small changes in the training data.

### Tradeoff
Reducing bias often increases variance, and reducing variance often increases bias.
The goal is to balance both for good generalization.
